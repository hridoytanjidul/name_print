CSE64K Pattern Generator

This project is a Java program designed to generate a custom ASCII-art-style pattern that spells out CSE64K using characters from predefined names. It is a fun and creative exercise to work with Java, lists, and loops.

Features

Dynamically generates a pattern spelling CSE64K.
Uses predefined names from different lists to form the letters.
Demonstrates advanced control structures and list manipulation in Java.
How It Works

The program uses multiple ArrayList collections to store predefined names.
Characters from these names are dynamically accessed and printed to form the pattern.
The output pattern is structured to resemble CSE64K.
